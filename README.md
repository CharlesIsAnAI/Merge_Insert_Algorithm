# Visual Algorithm Performance 

I have chose Merge_Insert Sort as a sample and put the output in the "sample output" folder.

## The work procedure

1. Automatically calculate estimated runtime, and assign a reasonable step for different algorithms;

2. Randomly generate an input for test;

3. Create diagram to analysis algorithms' performance.
